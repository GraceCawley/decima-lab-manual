# Offboarding {#offboarding}

![](img/adventure.jpg)

Everybody will at some point leave the group. Degrees get completed, jobs are obtained, super exciting! Having a clear offboarding process ensures there are no loose ends when a member leaves the lab, that others who might carry on work being done can do so most easily, and provides an opportunity to clarify any remaining steps (e.g. publication, future collaboartions).

## Exit Interview

Set up a dedicated time to meet with Gavin and/or your main collaborator (for undergraduate researchers) to talk about your time in the lab, and to go through the below checklist to make sure these have been done. Besides the checklist, things to talk about include the best part of being in our team, whether you got the support you needed and what could we improve for mentoring and training someone in your role in the future. 
[Checklist for students, staff, and post docs](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Z0Czwr3lRPGCgA-OP2WLGpWizJvsIUZ7_NOgVI4AfnQ/edit?usp=sharing)

## Project Documentation 

Project work should be hosted either in a github repository linked to from the faylab account, or saved on the lab_fay server drive (prefereably both).  

Each project should have an easily found README text file that provides information for others so they can navigate and use your work, and give contact information for authors (and any data creators/use restrictions if propietary data). Ideally, the README should also include links to publications and presentations from the work.  

## Publications and Presentations

Ensure that publications and presentations from your projects are archived in the appropriate folder on the lab Google Drive.  

## Data

Data used in support of your projects should be:

* Saved in appropriate, non-proprietary format with accompanying metadata
* Either in a public archive (e.g., the github repo or another public archive), or if data is proprietary, a 'snapshot' version of the data used in the project should be saved in a private repository accessible to lab members. Alternatively, data could be saved on the lab_fay server drive with appropriate documentation. 
* Linked and briefly described in the project README.  

## Code

Code used or developed for the project should be:

* complete and well-documented, including information in a README about what each file does and workflow to run the code
* Saved on the lab_fay section of the storage server, and also preferably available on github in a public repository.  
 
## Timelines for publications

Science is not finished until it has been communicated. Hopefully, you will publish your results in the peer-reviewed literature so that others can learn and build from your work. During your exit interview, make a plan with Gavin for remaining publications, including a timeline for submission.   

## Turning in equipment

Ensure any lab equipment (e.g. computer and peripherals) you have been using has been returned to the lab, office furniture is present and accounted for, and that tagged equipment has been logged in with Ashleigh. Make sure any problems with equipment are documented and that Gavin and Ashleigh have been made aware of them.  

## Lab library

The FayLab library is another of the many resources available to the Lab members. This library aims to provide resources to complement your learning in classes, thesis proposals, projects and other academic instances. The library is updated every year with literature that can be proposed by the students themselves or by Gavin. If you have any suggestion to add to our collection, please contact Gavin with all the book details and why do you think it would be a good addition to our collection. 

To use the books available in the FayLab, first check the book's inventory (link). Then, create a request with Gavin mentioning the book you want to use and the time you wish to keep the book. Once the request is accepted, update our book availability GitHub link with your name, the book you requested and the required dates. After the procedure is completed, you can take the book from the library located in the FayLab, room ###. 

To return the book, send an email to Gavin and update the list in our GitHub repo to keep track of booksâ€™ availability. Finally, return the book to our library shelf. 
If you want to add other resources, such as photocopies or class summaries, add them to the shelf and to our inventory (link) with all the necessary details such as class name, year, and a small description of the documents.

To maintain a productive and respectful environment please remember to follow the steps in this manual and be aware of the time you need to use the resources, remember that other members of the Lab may also require them. 

## Removing key card access

Key card access to the SMAST facilities will be terminated at the end of your contract. During your exit interview, discuss with Gavin whether modifications need to be made to this timeline.
