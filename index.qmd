# Welcome!

Welcome to Lab Manual.

<br> This is the lab manual for Decima Lab at the University of California: San Diego, Scripps Institution of Oceanography!\
The focus of our work centers around all things zooplankton. More about our group's research activity can be found on our [website](https://decimalab.ucsd.edu){target="_blank"}.

The purpose of this document is to help ensure a seamless transition into and throughout your time in the Decima Lab. This is a living document and is by no means exhaustive. The goal is to simply try to get lab members on the same page and to help everyone be as successful as possible. Additions and comments to this document are welcome and appreciated, all of our experiences together can only help future lab members. If you have suggestions for additions or changes.

DÃ©cima lab has a lot of moving pieces, and helpful tips and tricks we have learned along the way. This manual is a culmination of our experiences, and expectations as a lab. We started using this template from the Fay Lab starting in 2025. They built it as part of the [Openscapes Champions program](https://openscapes.org){target="_blank"}.\

We are extremely grateful to and acknowledge the hard work of all other labs who have pioneered the way in lab expectations (this is not an exhaustive list but ones we've pulled heavily from):
