More about our group’s research activity can be found on our website.\nThe purpose of this document is to help ensure a seamless transition into and throughout your time in the Decima Lab. This is a living document and is by no means exhaustive. The goal is to simply try to get lab members on the same page and to help everyone be as successful as possible. Additions and comments to this document are welcome and appreciated, all of our experiences together can only help future lab members. If you have suggestions for additions or changes.\n\nDécima lab has a lot of moving pieces, and helpful tips and tricks we have learned along the way. This manual is a culmination of our experiences, and expectations as a lab. We started using this template from the Fay Lab starting in 2025. They built it as part of the Openscapes Champions program.\n\nWe are extremely grateful to and acknowledge the hard work of all other labs who have pioneered the way in lab expectations (this is not an exhaustive list but ones we’ve pulled heavily from): Rennison Lab Kramer Lab Gibson Lab Munger Lab Sleep Equity Lab Meren Lab Quantitative Marine Ecology Lab Fay Lab\n\nThis lab is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.",

Our research explores how plankton growth, feeding, and waste drive carbon and nutrient fluxes, and how these processes are reshaped by climate stressors like warming, acidification, and wildfire inputs. By linking ecology and biogeochemistry, we aim to understand and predict how ocean ecosystems respond to rapid environmental change.\nSee the next chapter for more detail on our lab culture and philosophy.\nCurrently, we meet weekly lab meetings and individual meetings with Moira.\nTHINK ABOUT STRUCTURE FOR LAB MEETING. Each lab member has their own google doc for their 1:1 meetings with Moira. Prior to each meeting, create your agenda for that meeting there.",

    "section": "2.3 How we share things (and send them to Moira)",
    "text": "2.3 How we share things (and send them to Moira)\nWe think it is useful to have standard ways of sharing things. These don’t always have to be followed but are a useful guide and will make things easier. When sending material to someone, always make sure to describe what you are sending and try to make it as easy as possible for them to help you. Options like a ReadMe file can work, using comments in Excel or other docs sometimes make it hard to transfer to a coding language.\nTaking a project-based approach to organizing your work makes it easier to share and solicit feedback from others, as things tend to be self-contained. Try to keep only 1 working instance of material, and use some form of version control to facilitate this (see recommendations in Wilson et. al paper linked above).\nProject management tools in Github are a good way to record and document questions on analyses. Use ‘Issues’ on github repositories for project-related tasks and problems. Alternatively, make use of a GoogleDoc for each project to record this history, much like you would a lab notebook.\nCode: can be shared via Github repositories, or via a dedicated Google Drive folder. For specific questions on problems, please try to create a minimal reproducible example. Ensure that others can run and interact with the material being shared.\nWriting: Preferably via GoogleDoc, R Markdown, or Overleaf, but MS Word documents can also be shared. Google docs are particularly useful for collaborative writing, and have the advantage of there only ever being one version (as opposed to files that are sent around via email). Word documents should always have your last name as the first part of the file name (e.g. please no “mythesis.doc”).\nWe also share our institutional knowledge through our slack channel. ‘issues’ repository.\nWe maintain a lab Google Drive folder for lab publications, presentations, photos, CVs, etc. Please make use of these so that others in the lab can make fair use of our work. There are also personnel folders for storing material, as well as files for data storage that many will use (i.e Cruises, Procedures…)",

    "text": "We approach our science with a common denominator of kindness. As part of our core lab culture, we:\n\nAsk for help, and share our learning\nMake ourselves available\nCome prepared and engage\nCelebrate accomplishments (ours & those of others)\nSustain a positive, safe learning environment\nHave an interdisciplinary (open) mindset\nAre mindful of our own biases\nPlan with intention, and follow through\nFoster inclusivity within our group and greater community\nPromote and sustain healthy work-life integration\nPractice radical candor\nAcknowledge and give credit to other lab member’s work\n\nOur Lab Motto is: Everyone here is smart, get ahead by being kind.\nThough we do not expect incoming members to memorize everything, we do expect members to be aware of the group’s values.\nAsk for help, and share your learning: We are all learners, and most of our learning is done from each other. It is inefficient to struggle through problems alone. Ask for and give assistance with appropriate cognizance of the value of your time and the time of the person you are asking. You are not the first or last person to encounter a problem. Whether it’s about code, clarifying a travel policy, or an edit to the Lab website, we encourage you to make your learning experience accessible to everybody else too, which means sharing what you’re struggling with. When you identify a problem either propose a soluation via a pull request in github or send an email to Moira to help edit the website or whatever document is incorrect. It is always beneficail to write a Standard Operating Procedure when you discover something works well or found a solution to an on going problem.\nMake yourself available: Be responsive to communication, and make time for things that address longer term goals, even when busy. For example, do not skip on things like attending seminars just because you have a big deadline looming (see note below on planning and organization). Note that being available does not mean that you are available 24/7 - this is not expected, a work life balance is appreacited. We include regular opportunities to reorganize our priorities and plan accordingly, and shared time can be valuable for both group and individual goals. We value the role of collaboration and interaction in improving our work, so in-person availability for some time during normal business hours is expected (see section on attendance expectations).\nCome prepared and be engaged: Value your time. Be present during lab and individual meetings, and come ready to work. Contribute and participate in planning and lab discussions with curiosity, and without distractions. When it is your turn to run a meeting, come with an agenda and be prepared with questions. Aim to view meetings as a contribution to your work and productivity.\nCelebrate accomplishments (yours & others): You and your colleagues work hard. Things don’t always go exactly as you plan. Be supportive and proud of yourself and your peers when you accomplish things. We are not competing with each other - someone else’s success does not mean your failure, there is enough room for everyone to be successful. Share your accomplishments with others, and highlight the successes of your peers too! We want to know when you present at events big and small, make progress on academic goals, do good things in your community, and even when you take cool cruise sunset pics.\nSustain a positive, safe learning environment: Everyone learns something for the first time at some time. Expressing that you don’t know something or how to approach learning about it is OK, and we understand that this can make someone feel vulnerable. It is better to ask one million questions, than to make a preventable mistake. We strive to maintain a culture that allows for and encourages this vulnerability. Community members should not be disparaged for not knowing things, and in addition, should not be disparaged for knowing things or wanting to learn. If you want to do something but can’t do it yet, ask for help!\nHave an interdisciplinary (open) mindset: We apply our work at the science-policy interface. This means we work on problems that span multiple disciplines. Co-creation of knowledge requires approaches that can result in solutions that would not be possible with siloing. You will be collaborating with others who have different types of expertise, values, and terminology. Trust the expertise of others and actively seek feedback, recognizing the importance of specialization. This also means that when we communicate science, we acknowledge the people and perspectives that have produced that knowledge.\nBe mindful and aware of your own biases: We all have biases that are inherent and can not be removed, but we can still work on both being less biased, and more aware of bias in ourselves and others. Periodically check in on your biases.\nPlan with intention, and follow through: Be organized and adaptable. Things don’t always go as planned and that’s OK. Planning can help you adapt when they don’t (see Come Prepared). Find a program/project management approach that works for you (see “How we work”); being organized and prioritizing tasks can reduce stress and help you progress with your goals. Blocking calendar time, coworking, or having an accountability buddy are good tools to help you stay focused and set aside time to follow through with responsibilities.\nFoster inclusivity within our group and greater community: Part of our lab culture is that we are good citizens of our community, we take on leadership roles within SIO, CCE, and the University, we are supportive of others in our community during their milestones, we actively participate in SIO events (e.g. Scripps Student Symposium or CCE Forum) and engage with others in our work. We aim to be good neighbors who contribute meaningfully to the places we work, live, and frequent. Work with Moira when crafting your individual mentoring/development plans (see Chapter on Onboarding) to identify where to focus your efforts.\nPromote and sustain healthy work-life integration: Our scientific research is not the only important thing in our lives, and publishing research is not the only mechanism by which to provide science and support to our communities. We recognize the importance of our other commitments in keeping us mentally and physically healthy and allowing us to bring our whole selves to our efforts. Try not to normalize overwork or being busy as achievement or status. Do normalize spending time doing things that bring you joy outside of work and sharing these aspects of our humanity with each other.\nPractice radical candor: We care personally while also challenging directly. Be honest when communicating, accept critical (but kind) feedback, and give the same to others. We are here to work together, so if there are better ways we can do that then we communicate it and establish boundaries, and when we receive kindly delivered feedback, we genuinely consider and respond to it, without taking it personally.\nAcknowledge and give credit: Working as part of a team, we will often (always) be building on work done by others, receiving assistance with work (see “Ask for help”), and using others’ words, code, content. In the spirit of accessible, applicable, and reproducible science, we acknowledge and give credit for those contributions, in all forms of communication. We share content and code within the group with this expectation, honoring the collective responsibility of acknowledging the work of others, as this is what allows us to share freely. Some easy approaches include adding hyperlinks to the work of others or their social media in your work, including names and photos of your collaborators in presentations, and thanking them directly if they’re in the audience. This also helps to amplify their voice and work as well as yours.",

We do not tolerate harassment of group members or others in our larger communities in any form. Bullying is unwanted, aggressive behavior that involves a real or perceived power imbalance. The SIO - need to find, complaint procedures and form provides definitions and examples of harassment and sexual harassment.\nHarassment includes:\n\nOffensive comments related to gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, mental illness, neuro(a)typicality, physical appearance, body size, age, race, or religion.\n\nUnwelcome comments regarding a person’s lifestyle choices and practices, including those related to food, health, parenting, drugs, and employment.\nDeliberate misgendering or use of ‘dead’ or rejected names.\nGratuitous or off-topic sexual images or behaviour in spaces where they’re not appropriate.\nPhysical contact and simulated physical contact (eg, textual descriptions like “hug” or “backrub”) without consent or after a request to stop.\nThreats of violence.\nIncitement of violence towards any individual, including encouraging a person to commit suicide or to engage in self-harm.\nDeliberate intimidation.\nStalking or following.\nHarassing photography or recording, including logging online activity for harassment purposes.\nSustained disruption of discussion.\nUnwelcome sexual attention.\nPattern of inappropriate social contact, such as requesting/assuming inappropriate levels of intimacy with others\nContinued one-on-one communication after requests to cease.\nDeliberate “outing” of any aspect of a person’s identity without their consent except as necessary to protect vulnerable people from intentional abuse.\nPublication of non-harassing private communication.\n\nThe Décima lab prioritizes marginalized people’s safety over privileged people’s comfort. The PI (Moira Décima) reserves the right not to act on complaints regarding:\n\n‘Reverse’ -isms, including ‘reverse racism,’ ‘reverse sexism,’ and ‘cisphobia’\nReasonable communication of boundaries, such as “leave me alone,” “go away,” or “I’m not discussing this with you.”\nCommunicating in a ‘tone’ you don’t find congenial\nCriticizing racist, sexist, cissexist, or otherwise oppressive behavior or assumptions\n\n\n4.2.1 Reporting\nIf you are being harassed by a member of the Décima lab, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact the PI, Dr. Moira Décima, at mdecima@ucsd.edu. If you do not wish to contact Dr. Décima, please contact an Ombuds person. If the person who is harassing you is on the team, they will recuse themselves from handling your incident.\nLab members who believe they have been subjected to any kind of discrimination that conflicts with the University of California policies and/or the laws of the State of California should seek assistance from a supervisor or an HR representative.\nConfidentiality: Please remember that by way of her position at the university, Dr. Décima is a mandated reporter under Title IX. This means that she is not allowed to keep matters falling under Title IX confidential, and is required to disclose these incidents to the administration. You are welcome to discuss matters with Dr. Décima, but please keep this in mind when doing so. Moira will do her best to remind you of her responsibilities at the start of conversations anticipated to relate to these topics. If you would prefer to discuss incidents of harassment that fall under Title IX with a confidential source, you can contact INSERT CONTACT HERE.\nThis code of conduct applies to Décima lab spaces, but if you are being harassed by a member of the Décima lab or another member of the SIO community outside our spaces, we still want to know about it. We will take all good-faith reports of harassment by Décima lab members seriously. This includes harassment outside our spaces and harassment that took place at any point in time. The abuse team reserves the right to exclude people from the Décima lab based on their past behavior, including behavior outside Décima lab spaces and behavior towards people who are not in the Décima lab. The Counseling and Psychological Services (CAPS) provides a range of services to help students develop improved coping skills to address emotional, interpersonal and academic concerns.\nTo protect our team members from abuse and burnout, we reserve the right to reject any report we believe to have been made in bad faith. Reports intended to silence legitimate criticism may be deleted without response.\nThe above caveats noted, we will respect confidentiality requests for the purpose of protecting victims of abuse when possible. At our discretion, we may publicly name a person about whom we’ve received harassment complaints, or privately warn third parties about them, if we believe that doing so will increase the safety of the Décima lab members or the general public. We will not name harassment victims without their affirmative consent.\n\n\n4.2.2 Consequences\nParticipants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately.\nIf a participant engages in harassing behavior, Dr. Décima may take any action they deem appropriate, which includes referral to the Department Chair and Dean’s Office under the SIO policy, and also including expulsion from all Décima lab spaces.\n\n\n4.2.3 Additional resources\n\n\n4.2.4 UCOP (Systemwide)\n\nUC Policy on Sexual Violence and Sexual Harassment (SVSH)\n\nUC Anti-Discrimination Policy\n\nUC Statement of Ethical Values and Standards of Ethical Conduct\n\nUCOP Title IX Office\n\nSystemwide Anti-Discrimination Office\n\n\n\n4.2.5 UC San Diego\n\nOffice for the Prevention of Harassment & Discrimination (OPHD)\n\nReport Bias, Harassment, or Discrimination\n\nCARE at the Sexual Assault Resource Center (Confidential Support)\n\nUCSD Counseling and Psychological Services (CAPS)\n\nUCSD Ombuds Office (Confidential Conflict Resolution)\n\n\n\n4.2.6 Scripps Institution of Oceanography\n\nPreventing Harassment & Discrimination at Sea\n\nSIO Civility at Sea Training Videos\n\nSIO Shipboard Policies & Procedures\n\nSIO Diversity, Equity & Inclusion Resources",

There are conference roomas across Sverdrup that can be used for meetings or zoom calls. The picnic tables by Sverdrup are also great areas to work.\nLab meetings are hybrid, to allow for full participation even when members whose work location (including temporarily) is off-site.

    "text": "6.1 Working hours\nIn addition to agreeing to follow our communities codes of conduct and the university academic integrity policy, we expect everyone in the group to echo our lab culture (Chapter @ref(culture)).\nIndividual Development plans: Moira will work with each of you to develop your individual development plan that serves to ensure your time in the Decima lab progresses your short, medium, and long-term goals. This is a useful planning document that assists in aligning expectations. Graduate students will revisit the mentoring plan during an individual meeting with Moira at the beginning of each quarter & the start of summer. Other lab members will revisit these at appropriate time scales (e.g. every 6 months).\nA template for these, with thanks to @duffy_ma can be found here.\nIn addition, it is useful to have broad (for all lab members) and specific (i.e., grad students, research staff, etc.) expectations of our roles clarified. These are outlined below.\nMoira generally does not hold people to working a fixed schedule, or to be in the office for a certain schedule. As adults, we should all set the working schedule that is the right fit for us, and it is likely that what this ‘fit’ is will change over the course of the time you are in the lab. Depending on the nature of your appointment, there may be specific hours that will need to be worked and you should work with your main collaborator to outline these.\nMoira generally does not work evenings or on weekends, and does not expect that people in the lab are available at these times. Lab members should also not expect others to be available during these times.\nGraduate students are generally funded on annual research assistantship (RA) stipends. The RA contracts state that this stipend is for 20 hrs of work per week during the academic year and 40 hrs per week during summer to support full time study in the academic program. Most usually, students on RAships are being paid from a research grant where the focus of the grant is the topic the student is working on for their thesis research, so there is overlap here. We believe that training to do the research is part of the job, so this would include courses and additional time to read/learn methods, software too. Some people find that counting ‘billable hours’ is productive for them as it helps them keep accountable to themselves. Others do not find this method useful. Regularly assess what works best for you.\nFull time is enough, and we do not expect team members to work nights and weekends, though do not enforce a particular working hours schedule because students should feel flexible enough to create a work schedule that works for them. Lab members should not expect others to be available during evenings and weekends. There is value to interacting with others as part of your work, and we do expect you will be available during normal working hours for at least some of the time during the week. We also recognize that there will occasionally be times where there is a need to work more to meet a deadline, but this should be the exception - an expectation of overwork is not to be normalized.",

This includes communication with the lab team, your peers, collaborators, and also communicating your work to others. If someone works on something for you or provides you with feedback on your work, thank them and engage with them on their feedback. Our science improves by engaging with conversations about your work. View such interactions as opportunities to be collaborative rather than evaluative. Chances are if someone asks you questions about your work it is because they are interested in your science.\nAcknowledging communication and thanking others for their work is part of the profession, and it also helps collaboration by continuing conversation.\nWhile our philosophy applies, in that you shouldn’t feel like you have to be on email all the time, don’t let you email inbox become a black hole where questions / thoughts get sucked into and no response emerges.\nWe also believe in being intentional in communicating our work. While publishing and conference presentations are thought of as the standard forms in which science is disseminated, there are a number of ways in which you can communicate your work with others, depending on your audiences and chosen levels of engagement. You should always invest in these at the level that is of interest to you. Here are some things we recommend as members of our team.\nThis Inclusive Science Communication Starter Kit created and curated by Dr. Sunshine Menezes, the ED of the Metcalf Institute at URI, covers a wide range of topics related to inclusive science communication, education, and public engagement with STEM topics.

This means you need to stay on top of program and university deadlines, requirements, etc. See Chapter 14 (University of California: San Diego, Scripps Institution of Oceanography, and Décima Lab Resources) for links to resources.\nThe PhD Student Handbook and [MS Stsudent Handbook] (https://scripps.ucsd.edu/system/files/2025-01/MS%20Handbook%2024-25.pdf) should be the first port of call for information about program requirements, and what needs to be done when.\nRegistration: Academic credit registration management at UCSD is done through WebReg. Registration for each quarter takes place about mid-way through the previous quarter (see the university academic calendar for dates). It is critical to register promptly to facilitate faculty and institutional planning (and avoid late registration fees). When registering for each quarter, it may be good to discuss course options with Moira to see if she has any suggestions for your progress.\nSee Chapter @ref(courses) for details of courses available to BO graduate students.\nCourse of study should be selected with the program requirements in mind - as always, refer to the [PhD Student Handbook] (https://scripps.ucsd.edu/system/files/2025-01/PH.D.Handbook%202024-25_0.pdf) and [MS Student Handbook] (https://scripps.ucsd.edu/system/files/2025-01/MS%20Handbook%2024-25.pdf) for details.\nMost students take many of their core program requirements in the first year. Depending on the timing of course offerings, this will likely extend into the student’s second year.\nResearch units: If the student is not taking enough courses during a quarter to reach full-time status (12 units), the student will fill up the remainder of available units with research units (SIO 299). The student will develop goals and discuss them with Moira each quarter to guide their research efforts. Note that MS students must complete at least 12 research units leading up to the thesis.\nThe M.S. program is intended to be a two-year program. In the first-year, students will complete a majority, if not all, of their required coursework, and begin working on their research project. In the second year, students will primarily focus on their research project, while completing any remaining required or elective coursework. Students are not required to complete two years (six quarters) of study. It is possible for students to complete all program requirements in a shorter period of time. However, two years is the typical timeframe for completion.\nThesis Committee: Each first-year student is assigned a guidance committee. For BS/MS students, their guidance committee consists of the three members who signed off on their application. MS students are provided their guidance committee in their offer letter. The guidance committee is charged with advising until the student forms their thesis committee. The intent is to provide individualized guidance to students, particularly including advice about courses of study that may reach beyond a single curriculum, while ensuring that core requirements are being satisfied. Students are expected to meet with their guidance committee to discuss coursework and, if applicable, research direction. First-year students are required to submit the [Quarterly Guidance Committee Meeting Form] (https://scripps.ucsd.edu/system/files/2020-09/Guidance%20Committee%20Quarterly%20Meeting.pdf) to the department’s graduate coordinators. This form serves as a planning tool for the upcoming quarter. Once a student forms their thesis committee, the thesis committee is tasked with providing guidance and oversight through the completion of the student’s degree program.\nRemember, not everything will go to plan and your interests and findings may change. Content of theis proposals is not set in stone and can always be revised with communication and collaboration with the committee. View proposals as items that help you build your scientific products rather than evaluative procedures that need to be checked off.",

Moira encourages students to think about dissertation chapters as publishable units. In the disseration, these 3 chapters will be accompanied by a general Introduction, and a concluding Synthesis chapter that ties the work presented in the dissertation together under the overarching research theme and goals. ?\nMilestones\n\n10.2.1 Year 1 Coursework and Departmental Exam\nStudent completes core coursework. To be in good standing, students must maintain a GPA above 3.0 and successfully pass the departmental exam for their curricular group, which will normally be scheduled during the summer following the first year. Curricular groups specify their own expectations for the first year, which may include identifying an advisor (if the student starts out with a rotating advisor), identifying an initial research project, and possibly completing sufficient research to present results as part of the departmental exam.\n\n\n10.2.2 Year 2 Initial Research\nAt the start of the academic year, the student should work with the advisor to determine objectives for the year. This process can take advantage of information in the SIO Advisor/Advisee Expectations document and can make use of a student-initiated Individual Development Plan. In some curricular groups, students may be expected to complete additional coursework in year 2 (maintaining a GPA above 3.0). As an outcome of the departmental exam, the exam committee might communicate to the student specific recommendations to address identified shortcomings e.g. through additional coursework or supervised projects. Recommendations from the exam committee should be addressed in year 2 in consultation with the advisor and the exam committee. By the end of year 2, a student’s research progress should be sufficient to contribute to the first chapter of their PhD thesis. Students should fulfill the ethics course requirement (usually by taking SIOG232 Ethical and Professional Science or SIOB 273 Professional Ethics in Science).\n\n\n10.2.3 Year 3 Advancement to Candidacy (Qualifying)\nAt the start of the academic year, the student should work with the advisor to determine objectives for the year. Student should form their PhD thesis committee by the end of winter quarter. To be in good standing, the student must qualify by the end of Year 3*. Before qualifying, student should have completed all required coursework, as specified by their curricular group, including fulfilling the ethics course requirement. The qualifying exam requires writing and orally defending (to the PhD committee) a thesis proposal that lays out a research plan for the PhD thesis.\n\n\n10.2.4 Year 4 Ongoing Research\nAt the start of the academic year, the student should work with the advisor to determine objectives for the year. Student should meet with their PhD thesis committee at least once to check on progress since qualifying. By the end of year 4, student 11 will have completed and written up research representing at least half of the material that will appear in the final dissertation. Ideally, this will have been submitted as at least one journal article, and a second article may be in preparation.\n\n\n10.2.5 Year 5 Defending\nAt the start of the academic year, the student should work with the advisor to determine objectives for the year. Student should be well on their way to finalizing their PhD theses (e.g., research for all chapters is complete) at the end of year 5 in preparation for the upcoming defense. We recognize that there may be extenuating circumstances*, and the student’s advisor and the PhD thesis committee can agree to extend the student’s academic timeline beyond year 5 if adequate justification can be provided and if funding is available from the advisor.\n\n\n10.2.6 Pre-Qualifying Guidance Committee\nThe guidance committee is charged with advising the student during the first year and until the student forms their doctoral committee. The intent is to provide individualized guidance to students, particularly regarding advice about a course of study that may reach beyond a single curricular group. First-year students are expected to meet quarterly with their guidance committee to discuss coursework and, if applicable, research direction. First-year students are required to submit the [Quarterly Guidance Committee Meeting Form] (https://scripps.ucsd.edu/system/files/2024-10/%288%3A24%29Guidance%20Committee%20Quarterly%20Meeting.pdf) to the department’s Graduate Coordinator. This form serves as a planning tool for the upcoming quarter. Starting in year two, students are expected to meet with their guidance committee annually until the student constitutes their doctoral committee. The student and their guidance committee should make every effort to hold a single, in-person meeting. However, if this is not possible, the student can meet separately with individual members of the committee.\n\n\n10.2.7 Dissertation Committee\nThe Doctoral Committee will determine the student’s qualifications for independent research by conducting a Qualifying Examination, no later than the end of the student’s third year of study. The Doctoral Committee should be constituted no later than winter quarter of a student’s third year. Doctoral Committees in the Scripps Department consist of 4 members who hold appropriate instructional titles at UC San Diego (see eligibility table). Committee members are chosen from at least two departments, and at least two members must represent academic specialties that differ from the student’s specialty. This includes one member who is a tenured or Emeritus UC San Diego professor and one member from another UC San Diego department. Generally, 3 members of the committee are from the Scripps Department with at least one of those members in a curricular group different from the student. The member from another department can have a joint appointment with Scripps if the officially designated home department for their appointment is in a UC San Diego department other than Scripps. Each committee must have a Committee Chair. A Co-Chair may be appointed but is not required, unless the student is advised by an Adjunct Professor. A fifth member can be appointed to a student’s doctoral committee, at the discretion of the student’s Committee Chair(s) and upon approval by the Department Chair and Dean of Graduate Division. A fifth member is typically a second Researcher with a Lecturer’s Appointment or someone who is not eligible to serve as one of the required five members (e.g. Project Scientist or a professor from outside of the UC system). A copy of the fifth member’s CV is required, along with a justification of the individual’s inclusion on the committee.\n\n\n10.2.8 Departmental Exams\nAt the end of the first year, Ph.D. students are required to take the Departmental Exam which is administered by their curricular group. The Departmental Exam is intended to test the general scientific background of the student, the ability to integrate material from specific courses in analyzing new problems, demonstration of a reasonable degree of originality and insight, and the ability to present clear verbal and/or written arguments. Expectations and format varies with the curricular group.\n\n\n10.2.9 Qualifying Exam\nBy the end of the third year, PhD students are required to to lay out a research plan that they will tackle for dissertation, to convince a five-person committee that it is worthy of a Ph.D., to demonstrate that the student has the background and tools to carry out the plan and to assess whether it can be completed within normative time.\nThere should be some form of written proposal. This should lay out the problem that the student wishes to address, accompanied by a thorough review of the literature to provide context. A tentative outline with a list of proposed chapter titles for the dissertation is helpful, as is a timeline describing the status and the expected date of completion of each part. Each proposal should have publication quality illustrations with captions and a complete bibliography. It should have the look of a ‘real’ proposal typical in the student’s field. As a courtesy to the committee, the student should provide the proposal to the committee members at least three weeks prior to the exam. It is often helpful to discuss it with each committee member in advance.\n\n\n10.2.10 Final Defense\nThe doctoral committee supervises and conducts the oral defense and final examination, which shall be publicly held and so announced. The oral defense must be scheduled during the standard work week, Monday-Friday, and must be held during normal business hours. Defenses can be held in-person, virtually, or a combination of both. The committee chair and “upper campus”member must participate in the defense. One member of the committee, outside of the chair and “upper campus” member, can be absent from the defense. The student will need to make arrangements to present to that member prior to the defense. That member should forward any questions to the committee chair, to be discussed at the defense.\nRemember, not everything will go to plan and your interests and findings may change. Content of thesis proposals is not set in stone and can always be revised with communication and collaboration with the committee. View proposals and exams as items that help you build your scientific products rather than evaluative procedures that need to be checked off.",
